# **lvlUpLog!**

A platform for gamers to display things like their Discord, Steam, Favorite Game, Recently Played Games and a way for people to find others that share their interests!

### How the app works:

The main page of the site is a display of all the users that have signed into the site with clickable profile cards for you to be able to navigate to their profile and find more information about them and the games they play! The profile page allows you to display to others what you're into!

### Try it!:

### Motivation/Insipration:

Gaming is a big part of what I do in my free time so I wanted to create something I could actually use if I wanted to! Another big part of why I did this project specifically is because I could use an API. I think it's pretty cool stuff and I want to use API's in other personal projects so I figured why not get some experience now!
